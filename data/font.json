In addition, a host of thoughtful but unobtrusive OpenType features are built in and ready to assist with setting your composition.

Loosely inspired by its predecessors, Asoma riffs on aesthetics of the past, embedding new shapes and ideas with an offbeat sense of nostalgia. A plethora of ligatures give you the option to heavily customize headlines, titles and logotypes. Additionally, Asoma includes a full upper and lowercase character set, lining figures, math characters, punctuation, 5 distinct weights and support for Western European, Central European, South Eastern European and South American scripts.\n\nShort for asomatic, Asoma speaks with a voice that is somewhat otherworldly, a step away from the physical realm and existing in a more transcendental space. This makes Asoma a great option for horror film titles. For some reason, it also works surprisingly well on packaging for black beans. At heavier weights, Asoma communicates a nostalgic feeling, emulating the design of the 1970s. Asoma thin offers a more subdued feel, perfect for the contemporary design space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease specify quantity based on the End User License Agreement before purchasing.\n\nWrite jplatt79@gmail.com with licensing questions, access to trial fonts or our 40% student discount code!"

    "sellerText": "Lucifer features contemporary aesthetics while being deeply rooted in a lesser-known part of Swiss design history. The typeface has an almost menacing appearance. Its sharp, expressive serifs and overall organic look are inspired by the hand-lettering of Swiss designer Robert Stöcklin in his poster for the Schweizer Mustermesse Basel in 1924.\n\nWhile Lucifer takes many of the unique visual qualities of its historical reference material, it is also optimised for the demands of contemporary design professionals. Its expressive aesthetic excels in wordmarks, headlines, and poster designs. At the same time, the type system works just as well in various kinds of running text, which makes it a respectable, unique workhorse type family.\n\nThe type family consists of 8 cuts, which are Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold accompanied by their respective italics. In addition, it supports a wide range of Latin-based languages, including Vietnamese and Standard Mandarin Chinese via the official romanization system Pinyin to ensure the usability of the typeface in a broader international context.\n\nThis typeface was funded by Pro Helvetia, Swiss Art Council.\n\nSpecimen (PDF)\n\nSave 37,5% compared to buying all styles separately and get the variable font files on top!\n\nWhat do you get?\n\n→ The latest font file(s) of the styles Regular, Regular Italic, Medium, Medium Italic, SemiBold, SemiBold Italic, Bold, Bold Italic + Variable Font.\n→ The selected licence\n→ A specimen of the typeface (PDF)\n\nCan I try the font before buying?\n\nOf course, you can!

I wanted to make a typeface that tried to expand to fill its container in the same way, which is why there’s a slight convex touch to the verticals: the whitespace pushes out, while the letters push back.\n\nThe character set is minimal right now, but I’d like to keep expanding it. I’ll pass along any updates I make to the character set for free. If you need anything specific, email me and I’ll try and help.\n\nThis is a desktop and web license for 1-3 users, personal or commercial (with some limitations for larger companies and sites).

    "sellerText": "Expresii (www.expresii.com) is a new painting app featuring advanced brush and ink (watercolor) simulation + extremely high zooming capability for Windows. Enjoy the liberation and fun Expresii brush painting brings you!\n\nBy wielding such a virtual brush, you can make vastly different marks which normally require switching between many stamp-based 'brushes' in other programs. By eliminating explicit switching you can finally make expressive marks that capture your rhythm! Expresii is especially good for improvised sketching. Due to our nice rendering your sketches done in Expresii are immediately presentable!\n\nWater-based media have always been a challenge in digital painting technology. Many paint programs offer 'watercolor brushes', most of which are based on local diffusion or stamping scanned images. Nice results can be achieved but something important is missing - the fluidity. Our paint simulation, on the other hand, brings digital watercolor to a whole new level by using Computational Fluid Dynamics for natural flows. The use of GPU makes such a simulation fast enough for real-time interaction, even on a tablet computer.\n\nFinally, the simulation is paired with a new rendering method that gives you both raster richness and vector-like output up to 32k resolution. You can export your artwork with alpha channel to your favorite image editor for further processing. Our novel vexel rendering can enlarge an imported RGB image up to 40x and make it look as if done on paper so Expresii also doubles as an image enlarger for your existing illustrations.\n\nAfter purchase you get a PDF with a download link or you can download it directly here: https://expresii.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/rdtr/Expresii64_Setup.zip . Currency is USD.\n\nWarning: Expresii uses modern GPU for accelerated processing therefore it may not work correctly on older computers/drivers. Get a free key via https://gum.co/expresii_trial and make sure it works well (including saving function) on your computer before any commitment.\n\n建議先到這裡拿個免費 ‘試用Key’ ：https://gum.co/expresii_trial . 有了‘試用Key’ 才可有儲存的功能。把儲存功能也試好，覺得沒問題才回這裡買Full Key。注：價格是美金。\n\n中國的朋友：由於Gumroad 被中國牆了，請移玉步到微軟商店 https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9n8jxs6275rg 下載試用或購買Expresii商店版。謝謝！"

    "sellerText": "Lucifer features contemporary aesthetics while being deeply rooted in a lesser-known part of Swiss design history. The typeface has an almost menacing appearance. Its sharp, expressive serifs and overall organic look are inspired by the hand-lettering of Swiss designer Robert Stöcklin in his poster for the Schweizer Mustermesse Basel in 1924.\n\nWhile Lucifer takes many of the unique visual qualities of its historical reference material, it is also optimised for the demands of contemporary design professionals. Its expressive aesthetic excels in wordmarks, headlines, and poster designs. At the same time, the type system works just as well in various kinds of running text, which makes it a respectable, unique workhorse type family.\n\nThe type family consists of 8 cuts, which are Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold accompanied by their respective italics. In addition, it supports a wide range of Latin-based languages, including Vietnamese and Standard Mandarin Chinese via the official romanization system Pinyin to ensure the usability of the typeface in a broader international context.\n\nThis typeface was funded by Pro Helvetia, Swiss Art Council.\n\nSpecimen (PDF)\n\nSave 25% with this package compared to buying the styles separately.\n\nWhat do you get?\n\n→ The latest font file(s) of the styles Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic.\n→ The selected licence\n→ A specimen of the typeface (PDF)\n\nCan I try the font before buying?\n\nOf course, you can!

The conceptual process was developed by making a re-interpretation of the Caslon styles making different explorations by using a calligraphic nib pen in order to find a new personality to each letter. The result is a modern, elegant and experimental serif typeface. Delicate in its Extra Light version and impressive in the Bolder style. The sweep design hides harmonic adjustments based on geometric strokes that generate a unique and attractive texture. For a better experience we recommend you to use it in headlines instead of body text.\n\nVersion 1.0\nIncludes:\n+ 8 weights\n+ 1 variable font\n+ OTF features\n+ Character set that supports Western, Central and Southeastern European languages. + Script: latin\n______________________________________________________________\n\nQuestions?

modify fonts. Convert to paths and editing in programs such as Illustrator are permitted, provided the results are not converted back to font  software for redistribution.\n\nYou cannot redistribute fonts because copyright is still with us.\n\nEditing and / or changing the font name is not permitted, this is not an original font creation and does not negate the original license terms. The device can provide special font designs, adaptations and related licenses for all your needs.\n\nUsing font elements as the basis for new fonts is not permitted.\n\nIf you want the font to be used as part of the campaign, and need other agencies or individuals to use the same font, they must buy their own license from us as the seller and owner of the copyright font.\n\nRespect for copyright – the legal consequences of using non-licensed or adapted fonts can be very expensive and result in the removal of all offensive copies. Poorly adapted fonts are often found to have a number of serious technical and design errors, the most common being missing kerning (contextual letter space), missing characters, bad spaces, incorrect point construction, clash ID fonts and missing counters because of the wrong direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow our Instagram and Behance account for more update and hi-quality freebies:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/enxyclostudio\n\nhttps://www.behance.net/enxyclo\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you need a custom license, custom font project, or brand identity, please contact us on\n\nenxyclodigital@gmail.com"
