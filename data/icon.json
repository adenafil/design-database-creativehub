The blur effect is giving the eye perception of depth from a 2D perspective and plain of view while also maintaining a frosted glass effect.\n\nEchoes has over 630 icons so you have plenty of options to theme all of your iOS 16 icons and have a beautiful homescreen.\n\nEasily change your icons on iOS 17 trough the shortcuts app. You have plenty of tutorials if you search for it on how to do  it.\n\nEchoes includes:\n\nOriginal & colorful icons manually and individually designed.\n\n300x300 px resolution so it's all crispy clear whether you're using them on iPad or iPhone.\n\n\n\n\nBasic tutorial on how to use:\n\n\n\n-    Repeat this process for every icon you want to replace:\n\n-  Open the stock Shortcuts app\n\n-  Add a shortcut by tapping + at the top\n\n-  Tap 'Add Action'\n\n-  Tap 'Scripting'\n\n-  Tap 'Open App'\n\n-  Tap 'Choose' and select the app you want to replace\n\n-  Tap the ••• button\n\n-  Tap 'Add to Home Screen'\n\n-  Enter the app's name\n\n-  Tap 'Choose Photo'\n\n-  Choose the related echoes icon for it\n\n-  Tap 'Add'\n\nIf you want a more in-depth tutorial on how it's all done you have plenty of youtube videos that teaches you visually step by step what I've explained above.\n\nNotes:\nThis icon pack was created from scratch, meticulously designed each icon, this is not a pre-made icon pack template.\n\nIf you're jailbroken you can get this icon pack directly from Havoc\n\nEnjoy!\n\nThank you for your support :) .

I've included both a Stream Deck and Star Citizen profile that'll have keybinds for most icons set up already.\n\nDo I need a plugin for the auto-updating keybinds?\n\nYes. For the auto-updating keybinds to work on your Stream Deck, you need to install the Stream Deck Star Citizen plugin: github.com/mhwlng/streamdeck-starcitizen - the auto-updating keybinds won't work without it.\n\nHow do I install profiles for the keybinds?\n\nInstructions are included in a README file.\n\nWhat if I don't have a Stream Deck?\n\nNo problem! You could potentially use apps such as Deckboard or Macro Deck with the icons.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions or feedback?\n\nSend a message to glitchedinorbit@gmail.com or join the Discord server.\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\nIn getting this product, you confirm you agree to the following:\n\n• All sales are final.

    "sellerText": "With great icons comes great flexibility\n\nI designed LineKing icons to blend well in various contexts, sizes, and styles. As a result, it‘s an all-time bestseller with an enormous collection of 1,000 icons spanning 50 categories.\n\nPreview the Figma file\n\n\n\n\nOr feast your eyes in this embeded preview. Warning: Very long scroll.\n\nI warned ya. 😊\n\nKey features\n\n🏞 Rich in Details\nEach icon possesses just enough details to look stunning in small, medium and large sizes.\n\n🦚 Strong visual metaphors\nEach icon tells a different story, a combination of commonly-recognized symbols and wicked ones.\n\n🕸 Ultra consistency\nAll icons share a common visual language, such as curve radius, perspective, mood, and colours.\n\n🖊 Line thickness control\nThe Figma and Sketch files give you full control over the stroke weight.\n\n⚖️ Infinite scalability\nThis goes without saying, but all icons are optimized vectors. Give it a try by using the icons on a highway billboard.\n\nBundle up\n\nDue to the early success of LineKing and customers‘ requests to bring in colours, I also designed a successor called LineQueen. If you decide to get both, you‘ll get them at a bundled price of $90. No hurry—it‘s not time-limited.\n\nWhy should I buy premium icons?\n\nA solid icon set is like a microcosm of your brand.\n\nThere is a multitude of free icon sets available on the interwebs. But precisely because they are free, they are used by millions. I‘ve heard clients say, “Oh, I‘ve seen this icon set. It‘s from [icon store]. You can download it for free.”\n\nYou don‘t want your customers to say that to the icons used on your website. They‘ll perceive your brand as cheap and unreliable.\n\nPremium icons, on the other hand, bring more exclusivity to your projects since they are neither available nor affordable to everyone. And I try to control that by keeping the price on the high end, which tends to attract smaller but more loyal customers, using the icons more intentionally.\n\nWith my combined effort of being a bit exclusive and giving a creative emphasis on more expressive iconography, I bring pictograms that feel custom-made yet still applicable to most brands.\n\nHowever, if you truly want to go custom and hold an exclusive license, I‘d be happy to make custom iconography for your brand.\n\nCommon questions\n\n❓What file types do I get?\nSVG, PNG, Figma, Sketch and Iconjar. Need more? Write to me and I might consider adding more.\n\n❓What‘s the canvas size?\n64×64 pixels, with a safe area of 4 pixels around the edges.\n\n❓Can I tweak the line thickness?\nYes. Just open the Figma or Sketch file, select any of the lines, and go wild with the stroke thickness.\n\n❓Will I get a discount?\nSince you‘ve reached here, psst… each subscriber gets a voucher for a tiny discount. So, make sure you subscribe to my shop.\n\n❓In what ways can I use the icons?\nThe purchased icons come with the Standard license. If you need more legal freedom (such as using the icons in a product for sale) please refer to the Extended license.\n\n❓Why are you not offering a subscription?\nI believe in a straightforward approach. Although subscriptions might be more lucrative in the long for me, it creates an utterance “Ah, forgot to cancel my subscription” every year for you. I want to avoid that.\n\n❓Why is Jesus included as an icon?\nWhy not? There are also representatives of other world religions and spiritual paths. No other icon set has that. 😇\n\n❓Do you offer a refund?\nUnfortunately, due to the nature of the goodies being digital, I can‘t provide a refund.\n\n❓How will I get notified of future free updates?\nI‘ll send you an email after each update. If you miss it, just go to your Gumroad Library to download the latest batch.\n\nStill having questions? No worries. I‘m an email away.\n\nPast updates\n\n🗓 Oct 14, 2022\nEnormous update. All icons are now fully redone to be customized via Figma.\n\n🗓 Jun 2016\nIncluded support for IconJar.\n\n🗓 Dec 2015 Initial launch.\nCompleted all 1000 icons. Also did some shape improvements.\n\n🗓 Nov 2015 Initial launch.\nAdded 100 new icons, now totalling 900.\n\n🗓 Oct 2015 Initial launch.\nAdded 100 new icons, now totalling 800.\n\n🗓 Sep 2015 Initial launch.\nAdded 100 new icons, now totalling 700.\n\n🗓 Sep 2015 Initial launch.\nAdded 100 new icons, now totalling 600.\n\n🗓 May 2015 Initial launch.\nOriginally done for Sketch.\n\nSince you‘ve reached here, I have a secret to share. LineKing is currently on ProductHunt. If you give me an upvote and a comment there, I‘ll give you a 50% discount on your purchase.\n\nUpvote LineKing\n\nOnce you do that, write me, and I‘ll give you the discount code. 🎁"

Made for Figma, in Figma.\n\nWe won Product Hunt #1 Product of the Week. Thanks for the support!\n\n❖ Preview Untitled UI Icons in Figma\n\n❖ Learn more at untitledui.com/icons\n\n4,600+ essential Figma UI icons + 4x styles\n\nWe searched everywhere for the \"ultimate\" icon set for modern UI design to use across all our projects... We couldn't find an icon library for Figma we loved so we made one.\n\nMade for Figma, in Figma. 100% compatible with Figma's latest component properties and override features. Say goodbye to Illustrator.\n\nCrafted specifically for modern UI design. Clean, consistent, and professionally crafted. Purposefully not overly stylized and neutral enough for any project.\n\n4x flexible styles. Choose between minimal line, modern duocolor or duotone, or solid icon styles. Switch styles and maintain icon overrides in Figma like magic.\n\n4,600+ and counting. Packed full with everything you need to design modern and beautiful UI and websites. No more custom icons.\n\nNeatly organized + IconJar. The entire library is neatly organized alphabetically across 19 categories. We've also included an IconJar library with super-smart tags for quick search.\n\nSmooth corners by default. Untitled UI Icons use beautiful and naturally continuously 60% variable curves on all corners. We stress these tiny details because once you see it, you can't unsee it.\n\n2px stroke weight default. 2px stroke weight by default for visually-balanced icons across sizes. Plus, master icons with live corners are included, so you can tweak corners for your own custom libraries.\n\nOptimized SVG output. No unnecessary layers or shapes. SVG outputs are optimized for minimal file size, no unnecessary attributes, and infinite scalability.\n\nUse in unlimited projects. In fact, we designed it this way — to be as neutral, flexible, and scalable as possible to use as a single \"ultimate\" library for any project.\n\nLifetime updates. No subscriptions or \"upgrades\". Pay once and get lifetime updates forever. We're always making improvements to Untitled UI products.\n\nNot all icon libraries are equal\n\nThere are hundreds of icon libraries, but the majority of them are low-quality, designed for Illustrator, or simply too small — usually all three. We couldn't find an icon library for Figma we loved so we made one.\n\nWe’ve built this icon library to be professional quality, while neutral and flexible enough for any project.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\nUntitled UI Icons is the last icon library you'll need and comes packed full with everything you need to design modern and beautiful UI and websites.\n\n❖ Learn more at untitledui.com/icons\n\n❖ Learn what's new on our changelog\n\nWhy do I need a high-quality icon library?\n\nNothing stands out more in modern UI design than inconsistent icons. There are hundreds of icon libraries floating around the internet today, but the majority of them are low quality, buggy, overly stylized, or simply too small — usually all of these.\n\nYou don’t realize the power of a high-quality icon library until you start using one. A good icon library saves you time and money usually spent on meticulously creating icons one-by-one, or even worse, constantly fixing existing icons so they're more consistent and optically balanced.\n\nA good way to frame it is to ask the question, “will this icon library save me a few hours of work in a project?” If the answer is YES, it’s probably worth the investment. Then it becomes an asset you can use in unlimited future projects.\n\nWe’ve thought of everything you need for modern UI design and have wrapped it into one neatly organized package. Better yet, it's made for Figma, in Figma, which means they're carefully designed to be 100% compatible with Figma's latest component properties and override features.\n\nYou can use this icon library in unlimited projects. In fact, we designed it this way — Untitled UI Icons are designed to be 100% Figma native, consistent, professional quality, and neutral enough for any UI or web design project.\n\nHow are Untitled UI Icons different?\n\nWe get it. There are hundreds of icon packs. Why did we create another one?\n\nWhen we were building Untitled UI, we looked at dozens and dozens of open source and best-selling icon libraries. Some were good, but we found the vast majority lacked in quality, were overly stylized, or simply too small.\n\nThe main problem was that not a single one was set up to respect component overrides in Figma. For example, when you use an icon in a component and change the stroke color, as soon as you swap out that icon instance, you'll lose those overrides and have to add the stroke color again. The same goes for fill colors, stroke weights, opacity etc.\n\nWe realized we needed an “ultimate” icon library that was professional quality, but also big enough and neutral enough for any project, and designed to work seamlessly with Figma. We couldn't find an icon library we loved so we made one. Untitled UI Icons are made for Figma, in Figma, and tick all the boxes we were looking for. Basically, we made it for ourselves.\n\nAny questions?\n\nCheck out our Frequently Asked Questions page on our website.\n\nNote: Untitled UI is not affiliated with Figma or Figma's team, nor is it endorsed by Figma."

    "sellerText": "In an ocean of icons, I discovered uncharted waters. So, I built Spotless—an icon collection that feels custom yet applies to most brands. It‘s designed for businesses that understand the business value of unique iconography as part of their brand identity.\n\nEach icon in this collection is designed upon a shared visual language, using a delicate balance between lines and fills. Their style combines a serious and casual tone, built for brands that want to represent themselves as stable and reliable but also be friendly and approachable.\n\nWhat makes Spotless unique?\n\n✌️ Focus on quality rather than quantity; every icon is a distinct pictogram.\n\n👌 A delicate balance between lines and fills and a subtle hint of 3D.\n\n🤘 Designed upon a shared visual language.\n\n🤌 Features strong and sometimes unconventional visual metaphors.\n\n🤟 Evokes quirky and friendly but also stable and reliable feelings.\n\n🤞 Comes with a promise that you won‘t find it in any heavily discounted bundle.\n\nView Figma preview\nWhy should I buy premium icons?\n\nA solid icon set is like a microcosm of your brand.\n\nThere is a multitude of free icon sets available on the interwebs. But precisely because they are free, they are used by millions. I‘ve heard clients say, “Oh, I‘ve seen this icon set. It‘s from [icon store]. You can download it for free.”\n\nYou don‘t want your customers to say that to the icons on your website. They might perceive your brand as cheap, and unreliable.\n\nPremium icons, on the other hand, bring more exclusivity to your projects since they are not available, nor affordable to everyone. And I try to control that by keeping the price on the high end, which tends to attract smaller, but more loyal customers, using the icons more intentionally.\n\nWith my combined effort of being a bit exclusive and giving a creative emphasis on more expressive iconography, I bring forth pictograms that feel custom-made, yet are still applicable to most brands.\n\nHowever, if you truly want to go custom and hold an exclusive license, I‘d be happy to make custom iconography for your brand.\n\nCommon questions\n\n❓ What file types do I get?\nSVG, PNG, Figma, and Iconjar. Need more? Write to me and I might consider adding more.\n\n❓ What‘s the canvas size?\n64×64 pixels, with a safe area of 4 pixels around the edges.\n\n❓ Can I tweak the line thickness?\nDue to the nature of the icons—being a mix between lines and fills—all icons are outlined, and you can‘t tweak the line thickness.\n\n❓ Will I get a discount?\nSince you‘ve reached here, psst… each subscriber gets a voucher for a tiny discount. So, make sure you subscribe to my shop.\n\n❓ In what ways can I use the icons?\nThe purchased icons come with the Standard license. If you need more legal freedom (such as using the icons in a product for sale) please refer to the Extended license.\n\n❓ Why are you not offering a subscription?\nI believe in a straightforward approach. Although subscriptions might be more lucrative in the long for me, it creates an utterance “Ah, forgot to cancel my subscription” every year for you. I want to avoid that.\n\n❓ Do you offer a refund?\nUnfortunately, due to the nature of the goodies being digital, I can‘t provide a refund.\n\n❓ How will I get notified of future free updates?\nI‘ll send you an email after each update. If you miss it, just go to your Gumroad Library (if you created an account when you purchased the icons) or find the original email receipt that you receive upon purchasing the icons.\n\nStill having questions? No worries. I‘m an email away.\n\nPast updates\n\n🗓 Sep 28, 2022\nOfficially launched version 1 of Spotless icons with 500 icons strong.\nRead update →\n\n🗓 Aug 24, 2022\nReleased the third batch of 100 icons during a presale stage, amounting to 300 icons at a 40% discount, limited to 60 seats.\n\n🗓 July 4, 2022\nReleased the second batch of 100 icons during a presale stage, amounting to 200 icons at a 60% discount, limited to 40 seats.\n\n🗓 Jun 15, 2022\nReleased the first batch of 100 icons during a presale stage, at an 80% discount, limited to 20 seats."

That's why I'm excited to introduce Ideate Icons, the icon pack that I've created for everyone who values quality and efficiency in their design process. Here are 5 reasons why Ideate Icons is the perfect addition to your design toolkit:\n\n1.

Versatile for every project: With over 2000 essential icons across more than 20 categories, Ideate Icons is suitable for creating modern and consistent designs for every type of website or mobile app project.

Two typestyles to fit your needs: Whether you prefer line or solid typestyles, Ideate Icons offers both options, giving you the flexibility to create any type of modern website or mobile app design you envision.\n\n4. Optimized for performance: Our minimalist icons are optimized for performance, with no extra layers or shapes used, ensuring that the SVG files are lightweight and easy to load on any device.\n\n5. Designed with Figma and compatible with everything: With the icons created in Figma, you can easily change the scale and tone to fit your design needs, and export them into SVG, PNG, and other formats for compatibility with any design tool or platform.\n\n6. Fully Editable with Figma: Ideate Icons are fully editable on Figma, meaning you can customize them to fit your design needs.
