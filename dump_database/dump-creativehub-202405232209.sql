As a result, it‘s an all-time bestseller with an enormous collection of 1,000 icons spanning 50 categories.\n\nPreview the Figma file\n\n\n\n\nOr feast your eyes in this embeded preview. Warning: Very long scroll.\n\nI warned ya. 😊\n\nKey features\n\n🏞 Rich in Details\nEach icon possesses just enough details to look stunning in small, medium and large sizes.\n\n🦚 Strong visual metaphors\nEach icon tells a different story, a combination of commonly-recognized symbols and wicked ones.\n\n🕸 Ultra consistency\nAll icons share a common visual language, such as curve radius, perspective, mood, and colours.\n\n🖊 Line thickness control\nThe Figma and Sketch files give you full control over the stroke weight.\n\n⚖️ Infinite scalability\nThis goes without saying, but all icons are optimized vectors. Give it a try by using the icons on a highway billboard.\n\nBundle up\n\nDue to the early success of LineKing and customers‘ requests to bring in colours, I also designed a successor called LineQueen. If you decide to get both, you‘ll get them at a bundled price of $90. No hurry—it‘s not time-limited.\n\nWhy should I buy premium icons?\n\nA solid icon set is like a microcosm of your brand.\n\nThere is a multitude of free icon sets available on the interwebs. But precisely because they are free, they are used by millions. I‘ve heard clients say, “Oh, I‘ve seen this icon set. It‘s from [icon store]. You can download it for free.”\n\nYou don‘t want your customers to say that to the icons used on your website. They‘ll perceive your brand as cheap and unreliable.\n\nPremium icons, on the other hand, bring more exclusivity to your projects since they are neither available nor affordable to everyone. And I try to control that by keeping the price on the high end, which tends to attract smaller but more loyal customers, using the icons more intentionally.\n\nWith my combined effort of being a bit exclusive and giving a creative emphasis on more expressive iconography, I bring pictograms that feel custom-made yet still applicable to most brands.\n\nHowever, if you truly want to go custom and hold an exclusive license, I‘d be happy to make custom iconography for your brand.\n\nCommon questions\n\n❓What file types do I get?\nSVG, PNG, Figma, Sketch and Iconjar. Need more? Write to me and I might consider adding more.\n\n❓What‘s the canvas size?\n64×64 pixels, with a safe area of 4 pixels around the edges.\n\n❓Can I tweak the line thickness?\nYes. Just open the Figma or Sketch file, select any of the lines, and go wild with the stroke thickness.\n\n❓Will I get a discount?\nSince you‘ve reached here, psst… each subscriber gets a voucher for a tiny discount. So, make sure you subscribe to my shop.\n\n❓In what ways can I use the icons?\nThe purchased icons come with the Standard license. If you need more legal freedom (such as using the icons in a product for sale) please refer to the Extended license.\n\n❓Why are you not offering a subscription?\nI believe in a straightforward approach. Although subscriptions might be more lucrative in the long for me, it creates an utterance “Ah, forgot to cancel my subscription” every year for you. I want to avoid that.\n\n❓Why is Jesus included as an icon?\nWhy not? There are also representatives of other world religions and spiritual paths. No other icon set has that. 😇\n\n❓Do you offer a refund?\nUnfortunately, due to the nature of the goodies being digital, I can‘t provide a refund.\n\n❓How will I get notified of future free updates?\nI‘ll send you an email after each update. If you miss it, just go to your Gumroad Library to download the latest batch.\n\nStill having questions? No worries. I‘m an email away.\n\nPast updates\n\n🗓 Oct 14, 2022\nEnormous update.

There are hundreds of icon libraries floating around the internet today, but the majority of them are low quality, buggy, overly stylized, or simply too small — usually all of these.\n\nYou don’t realize the power of a high-quality icon library until you start using one. A good icon library saves you time and money usually spent on meticulously creating icons one-by-one, or even worse, constantly fixing existing icons so they\'re more consistent and optically balanced.\n\nA good way to frame it is to ask the question, “will this icon library save me a few hours of work in a project?” If the answer is YES, it’s probably worth the investment. Then it becomes an asset you can use in unlimited future projects.\n\nWe’ve thought of everything you need for modern UI design and have wrapped it into one neatly organized package. Better yet, it\'s made for Figma, in Figma, which means they\'re carefully designed to be 100% compatible with Figma\'s latest component properties and override features.\n\nYou can use this icon library in unlimited projects. In fact, we designed it this way — Untitled UI Icons are designed to be 100% Figma native, consistent, professional quality, and neutral enough for any UI or web design project.\n\nHow are Untitled UI Icons different?\n\nWe get it. There are hundreds of icon packs. Why did we create another one?\n\nWhen we were building Untitled UI, we looked at dozens and dozens of open source and best-selling icon libraries. Some were good, but we found the vast majority lacked in quality, were overly stylized, or simply too small.\n\nThe main problem was that not a single one was set up to respect component overrides in Figma. For example, when you use an icon in a component and change the stroke color, as soon as you swap out that icon instance, you\'ll lose those overrides and have to add the stroke color again. The same goes for fill colors, stroke weights, opacity etc.\n\nWe realized we needed an “ultimate” icon library that was professional quality, but also big enough and neutral enough for any project, and designed to work seamlessly with Figma. We couldn\'t find an icon library we loved so we made one. Untitled UI Icons are made for Figma, in Figma, and tick all the boxes we were looking for. Basically, we made it for ourselves.\n\nAny questions?\n\nCheck out our Frequently Asked Questions page on our website.\n\nNote: Untitled UI is not affiliated with Figma or Figma\'s team, nor is it endorsed by Figma.','https://untitledui.gumroad.com/l/icons?layout=discover&recommended_by=search',59,2),(53,'50+ App Icons for iPhone and Mac v1.1','https://public-files.gumroad.com/w3rkxlieb8cq4l39gnfn6ynqm8yp',47,'A versatile pack of 50 meticulously crafted app icons tailored for the design community, available for use across iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices.

So, I built Spotless—an icon collection that feels custom yet applies to most brands. It‘s designed for businesses that understand the business value of unique iconography as part of their brand identity.\n\nEach icon in this collection is designed upon a shared visual language, using a delicate balance between lines and fills. Their style combines a serious and casual tone, built for brands that want to represent themselves as stable and reliable but also be friendly and approachable.\n\nWhat makes Spotless unique?\n\n✌️ Focus on quality rather than quantity; every icon is a distinct pictogram.\n\n👌 A delicate balance between lines and fills and a subtle hint of 3D.\n\n🤘 Designed upon a shared visual language.\n\n🤌 Features strong and sometimes unconventional visual metaphors.\n\n🤟 Evokes quirky and friendly but also stable and reliable feelings.\n\n🤞 Comes with a promise that you won‘t find it in any heavily discounted bundle.\n\nView Figma preview\nWhy should I buy premium icons?\n\nA solid icon set is like a microcosm of your brand.\n\nThere is a multitude of free icon sets available on the interwebs. But precisely because they are free, they are used by millions. I‘ve heard clients say, “Oh, I‘ve seen this icon set. It‘s from [icon store]. You can download it for free.”\n\nYou don‘t want your customers to say that to the icons on your website. They might perceive your brand as cheap, and unreliable.\n\nPremium icons, on the other hand, bring more exclusivity to your projects since they are not available, nor affordable to everyone. And I try to control that by keeping the price on the high end, which tends to attract smaller, but more loyal customers, using the icons more intentionally.\n\nWith my combined effort of being a bit exclusive and giving a creative emphasis on more expressive iconography, I bring forth pictograms that feel custom-made, yet are still applicable to most brands.\n\nHowever, if you truly want to go custom and hold an exclusive license, I‘d be happy to make custom iconography for your brand.\n\nCommon questions\n\n❓ What file types do I get?\nSVG, PNG, Figma, and Iconjar. Need more? Write to me and I might consider adding more.\n\n❓ What‘s the canvas size?\n64×64 pixels, with a safe area of 4 pixels around the edges.\n\n❓ Can I tweak the line thickness?\nDue to the nature of the icons—being a mix between lines and fills—all icons are outlined, and you can‘t tweak the line thickness.\n\n❓ Will I get a discount?\nSince you‘ve reached here, psst… each subscriber gets a voucher for a tiny discount. So, make sure you subscribe to my shop.\n\n❓ In what ways can I use the icons?\nThe purchased icons come with the Standard license. If you need more legal freedom (such as using the icons in a product for sale) please refer to the Extended license.\n\n❓ Why are you not offering a subscription?\nI believe in a straightforward approach. Although subscriptions might be more lucrative in the long for me, it creates an utterance “Ah, forgot to cancel my subscription” every year for you. I want to avoid that.\n\n❓ Do you offer a refund?\nUnfortunately, due to the nature of the goodies being digital, I can‘t provide a refund.\n\n❓ How will I get notified of future free updates?\nI‘ll send you an email after each update.

That\'s why I\'m excited to introduce Ideate Icons, the icon pack that I\'ve created for everyone who values quality and efficiency in their design process. Here are 5 reasons why Ideate Icons is the perfect addition to your design toolkit:\n\n1. Consistency at its finest: I\'ve created these icons by following Apple\'s icon guidelines, which means every icon is designed with the same optical weight, line, and positioning, making them work seamlessly together as a family.\n\n2. Versatile for every project: With over 2000 essential icons across more than 20 categories, Ideate Icons is suitable for creating modern and consistent designs for every type of website or mobile app project. From e-commerce to education, social media to healthcare - you name it, we\'ve got it covered. We regularly update Ideate Icons with new categories and icons based on customer feedback, so you can stay on top of the latest design trends and keep your projects fresh and relevant.\n\n3. Two typestyles to fit your needs: Whether you prefer line or solid typestyles, Ideate Icons offers both options, giving you the flexibility to create any type of modern website or mobile app design you envision.\n\n4. Optimized for performance: Our minimalist icons are optimized for performance, with no extra layers or shapes used, ensuring that the SVG files are lightweight and easy to load on any device.\n\n5. Designed with Figma and compatible with everything: With the icons created in Figma, you can easily change the scale and tone to fit your design needs, and export them into SVG, PNG, and other formats for compatibility with any design tool or platform.\n\n6. Fully Editable with Figma: Ideate Icons are fully editable on Figma, meaning you can customize them to fit your design needs. From changing the stroke size to adjusting the corner radius, you have full control over every aspect of the icons.\n\n*Used & loved by more than 7,000 designers+developers from all over the world*\n\n2150+ icons with 20+ Categories ( Last update Aug 2022 )\n\nInterface - 200+\n\nE-Commerce - 200+\n\nFinance - 200+\n\nNavigation - 100+\n\nArrows - 200+\n\nMedia - 100+\n\nSecurity - 100+\n\nCommunication - 100+\n\nDate and Time - 100+\n\nReal Estate - 100+\n\nHealth - 100+\n\nFood and Drinks - 100+\n\nEducation - 100+\n\nTransportation - 100+\n\nTechnology - 50+\n\nWeather - 50+\n\nSports - 50+\n\nUser Profile - 50+\n\nCode and Design - 50+\n\nRequested icons - 50+\n\nAvailable in all file formats\n\nideate icons provided essential formats that are used by developers and designers all over the world, also more formats are coming soon near future.\n\nFigma File\n\nSketch File\n\nSVG Files\n\nPNG Files\n\nIcon jar (coming soon)\n\nwebsite (coming soon)\n\nSupport & Request for new categories\n\nFor asking any other questions and requesting any new icons or icons categories 📨 Inbox us on Twitter\n\nLicense\n\nAny license allows you to use icons in an unlimited number of personal and commercial projects.\n\n- Do not try to sell icons as your own in original or modified form.\n\n- Do not try to distribute the product for free.\n\nFollow for more\n\nTwitter | Behance  | Medium | Youtube\n\n\n','https://zesan.gumroad.com/l/icons?layout=discover&recommended_by=search',0,2),(65,'Flvt for iOS & Android','https://public-files.gumroad.com/q8djpz37sqgtacck8x3bautenv8b',53,'Minimal icons design for expressed simple things.\n\nSelect which version you want from options.\n\nThere\'s Flvt Bundle option also available in 30% discounted price.\n\nFlvt Features :\n\n• 1000+ icons\n\n• 26 wallpapers (credit to original creator\'s)\n\nA pack of 26 wallpapers that you can download here - https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gejn9rmseeedyzn/AABwE8WdJSLbABHRg42b1WmVa?dl=0\n\nFlvt Updates :\n\n• Flvt will get updates every weeks containing 50 new icons.\n\n• Redesign existing icons\n\n• Updates might be delayed if i’m busy because I\'m human.\n\nFollow me Devy_Design on twitter for more themes.\n\nFlvt icon requests :\n\n• For icon request, suggestions & new ideas so you can make your requests on this mail id (idrainmax@gmail.com)\n\n• Provide proof of purchase (transaction or Receipt screenshot)\n\n• You can request up to 5 icons\n\nAlso Checkout my other themes\n\nLiaca Glyphs for iOS & Android \n\nLiaca for iOS & Android\n\n3d Liaca for iOS & Android\n\nLiaca Glassy for iOS & Android\n\nGyan for iOS & Android \n\nDevy Wallpaper Pack\n\nillusion Wall Pack\n\nGradient Wall Pack\n\nif You looking for all Liaca + Liaca Glyphs Bundle in Addition discount checkout here','https://devydesign.gumroad.com/l/flvticons?layout=discover&recommended_by=search',2,2),(66,'Cyber Y2K Shape','https://public-files.gumroad.com/pza57ejvtok64dn04d4iq0xkg84f',56,'222 retro-futuristic Y2K elements inspired by all the good sci-fi graphics of the ’80s, ’90s, and 2000s Ideal for streetwear fashion brands, album art, logo designs, posters, and social media graphics.

We tried a bunch of Figma UI kits, but found they lacked in size, flexibility, or quality — usually all three — and we ended up having to remake all the poor-quality components.\n\nWe needed an “ultimate starter” kit for new freelance projects and design systems, rather than having to start from scratch each time. We were sick of rebuilding the same common components over and over again... which is not only a waste of time, but the most boring part of the design process.\n\nUntitled UI was built to solve this. We’ve thought of everything you need to design modern and beautiful UI and websites and have wrapped it into one neatly organized package.\n\nYou can use this UI kit in unlimited projects. In fact, we designed it this way — to be as neutral, flexible, and scalable as possible to use as a kick-starter for any project.\n\nAny questions?\n\nCheck out our Frequently Asked Questions page on our website.\n\nNote: Untitled UI is not affiliated with Figma or Figma\'s team, nor is it endorsed by Figma.','https://untitledui.gumroad.com/l/untitled-ui?layout=discover&recommended_by=search',129,5),(203,'Ionic Design Kit for Figma','https://public-files.gumroad.com/9s6cm9bc4lpcj7rsr73rqw30xrkr',125,'Download free demo now »\nDesign & build Ionic 7+ hybrid apps 80% faster. \nBased on the popular Ionic Sketch UI Kit and latest Ionic 7 components.\n\nGet 80 responsive up-to-date Ionic 7 components and speed-up your design & development process by 80%. \n\nFine-tune the designs using 150+ interconnected and fully-customizable Sketch symbols.\n\nA dark theme for your dark creative ideas is also included.\n\nDesign for iOS and Android.\n\n\nThis UI kit saves HOURS.

Its sharp, expressive serifs and overall organic look are inspired by the hand-lettering of Swiss designer Robert Stöcklin in his poster for the Schweizer Mustermesse Basel in 1924.\n\nWhile Lucifer takes many of the unique visual qualities of its historical reference material, it is also optimised for the demands of contemporary design professionals. Its expressive aesthetic excels in wordmarks, headlines, and poster designs. At the same time, the type system works just as well in various kinds of running text, which makes it a respectable, unique workhorse type family.\n\nThe type family consists of 8 cuts, which are Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold accompanied by their respective italics. In addition, it supports a wide range of Latin-based languages, including Vietnamese and Standard Mandarin Chinese via the official romanization system Pinyin to ensure the usability of the typeface in a broader international context.\n\nThis typeface was funded by Pro Helvetia, Swiss Art Council.\n\nSpecimen (PDF)\n\nSave 37,5% compared to buying all styles separately and get the variable font files on top!\n\nWhat do you get?\n\n→ The latest font file(s) of the styles Regular, Regular Italic, Medium, Medium Italic, SemiBold, SemiBold Italic, Bold, Bold Italic + Variable Font.\n→ The selected licence\n→ A specimen of the typeface (PDF)\n\nCan I try the font before buying?\n\nOf course, you can!

Enjoy the liberation and fun Expresii brush painting brings you!\n\nBy wielding such a virtual brush, you can make vastly different marks which normally require switching between many stamp-based \'brushes\' in other programs. By eliminating explicit switching you can finally make expressive marks that capture your rhythm! Expresii is especially good for improvised sketching. Due to our nice rendering your sketches done in Expresii are immediately presentable!\n\nWater-based media have always been a challenge in digital painting technology. Many paint programs offer \'watercolor brushes\', most of which are based on local diffusion or stamping scanned images. Nice results can be achieved but something important is missing - the fluidity. Our paint simulation, on the other hand, brings digital watercolor to a whole new level by using Computational Fluid Dynamics for natural flows. The use of GPU makes such a simulation fast enough for real-time interaction, even on a tablet computer.\n\nFinally, the simulation is paired with a new rendering method that gives you both raster richness and vector-like output up to 32k resolution. You can export your artwork with alpha channel to your favorite image editor for further processing. Our novel vexel rendering can enlarge an imported RGB image up to 40x and make it look as if done on paper so Expresii also doubles as an image enlarger for your existing illustrations.\n\nAfter purchase you get a PDF with a download link or you can download it directly here: https://expresii.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/rdtr/Expresii64_Setup.zip .

The typeface has an almost menacing appearance. Its sharp, expressive serifs and overall organic look are inspired by the hand-lettering of Swiss designer Robert Stöcklin in his poster for the Schweizer Mustermesse Basel in 1924.\n\nWhile Lucifer takes many of the unique visual qualities of its historical reference material, it is also optimised for the demands of contemporary design professionals. Its expressive aesthetic excels in wordmarks, headlines, and poster designs. At the same time, the type system works just as well in various kinds of running text, which makes it a respectable, unique workhorse type family.\n\nThe type family consists of 8 cuts, which are Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold accompanied by their respective italics. In addition, it supports a wide range of Latin-based languages, including Vietnamese and Standard Mandarin Chinese via the official romanization system Pinyin to ensure the usability of the typeface in a broader international context.\n\nThis typeface was funded by Pro Helvetia, Swiss Art Council.\n\nSpecimen (PDF)\n\nSave 25% with this package compared to buying the styles separately.\n\nWhat do you get?\n\n→ The latest font file(s) of the styles Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic.\n→ The selected licence\n→ A specimen of the typeface (PDF)\n\nCan I try the font before buying?\n\nOf course, you can!

For wholesale purchasing, contact us directly at bruiser.magazine@gmail.com\n\nOn a day like any other, Neil receives a devastating communication: he has been selected to participate in his town\'s annual Founders\' Day Game, a compulsory fight to the death between two citizens. Will Neil stoically face near-certain death, or will he manage to find someone else to take his place?\n\nThe third volume in the BRUISER Zines series, Founders\' Day is a short story by the Philadelphia writer Arzhang Zafar, whose previous work can be found in BRUISER and Apocalypse Confidential. Printed and assembled in Baltimore with art by Jun Wilkinson, this limited edition zine is a pitch-black social satire of the arbitrary violence endemic to fascist culture.\n\n\"Founders\' Day conjures an Omelas-dystopia through the lens of the now infamous tweet, \"Why do we...never question if the child has bad vibes?\" Arzhang Zafar\'s dry wit paints the unflattering image of a man, more cockroach than human, desperate to survive within the very community which has nominated him to fight for his life.

These are ordinary people butting up against extraordinary circumstances; there’s emotional weight and prose that cuts like a knife while dripping style. This is David Simmons’ world, we’re just lucky enough to live in it.\"\n\n-- Justin Lutz, author of Gemini Rising and Gone to Seed\n\nThe fifth volume in the BRUISER Zines series, Foul Black Rookeries is a collection of four stories by Baltimore writer David Simmons. Printed and assembled in Baltimore, this limited edition zine is a startling portrait of Baltimore as seen through Simmons\' grimy lens, taking the warts-and-all approach of crime fiction and pushing it somewhere stranger and more terrifying.\n\n\"Simmons is a chameleon of prose, slipping into the minds of his characters and the landscapes of his bizarro Baltimore with ease, imbuing each story with a profound authenticity borne not only from an attentiveness to the world, but even more so a clear and ineffable passion for the inner workings of things--whether they be fantastic biologies or makeshift weapons or philosophical frameworks. It\'s all as real as it is surreal.\"\n\n-- Arzhang Zafar, author of Founders’ Day\n\n\"David Simmons is the Joyce Carol Oates of Charm City.\"\n\n-- Brian Allen Carr, author of Opioid, Indiana and Bad Foundations\n\n\"David Simmons is the most exciting, wildest writer I\'ve come across in years.He\'ll make you wince from horror, laugh from dialogue, and then, when you\'re distracted by eldritch gods and conceptual madness, he\'ll emotionally gut you. One of the very best.\n\n-- e. rathke, author of Howl and Glossolalia\n\n\"Foul Black Rookeries is a small collection of short stories with a brilliant yet uncompromising imagination and colossal prose. You’ll find an intermingling of urban grit with old school horror sensibilities that only Simmons could cook up. These stories will cut you with a surgeon’s precision and unearth emotions you didn’t even know were lying dormant.\"\n\n-- Grant Wamack, author of Bullet Tooth\n\n\"David Simmons burst on the scene with a voice so confident and precise that he must have honed it in a past life. He will be one of the greats. I have no doubt about that.\"\n\n-- J. David Osborne, author of Dying World and War in Heaven\n\n\"Not since Vonnegut has there been a more distinct and perfect alchemy of absurdism, heart, and intellect than in the work of David Simmons.\"\n\n-- Kelby Losack, author of Mercy and Letting Out The Devils\n\n\"Simmons replicates the experience of stress into a surrealism of violence.

Will it give me a sign? I would like to pour my heart into the embodiment of the Paris, Texas monologue, but instead of separated lovers, it’s me trying to poeticize the detritus in my brain and I can’t quite see who I am talking to.\n\nGoogle searches are poems. Spam emails are poems. Being lost is a poem. Everything reflects some part of me back to myself. It’s all kind of embarrassing.\n\nThe images and texts in Saturn Returns chronicle a strange time when Saturn re-entered the place it was at my birth, a difficult period of a few years that most astrologers believe to be the hallmark of adulthood. This doorway also acted as a mirror, one that reflected my utter confusion, moments of scrying at divinity, a war with my body. Filled with yearning and uncertainty, images from everyday are stacked and arranged to approximate a poem. From this arrangement comes another poem. They reflect back at each other–trying to understand.\n\nThe fourth volume in the BRUISER Zines series, Saturn Returns is a mixed-media collage of phone screenshots, photos, found images, and poetry by the Los Angeles-based artist and writer Ashley E Walters. Printed and assembled in Baltimore, this limited edition zine is an intimate, bittersweet meditation on the small moments and questions that accumulate over the course of existing in a mundane-yet-complex world.\n\n\n\n\n\nPOV: you’re spending one golden afternoon, or maybe one manic morning or one cool neon night in Ashley E. Walters eyeballs seeing what she’s seeing, scrolling what she’s scrolling.\n\nPOV: you just picked up Saturn Returns. This deft collection of poem-image-poems gives you the uncanny and sublime sensation of stepping into Walters’ skin and holding in your/her hand your/her cellphone and generating questionable google search histories via stream-of-consciousness-intrusive-thought search sprees. The barrier between image and poem dissolves as does the boundary between worlds outside and inside the phone while you hold it up to take a photo and receive a text containing a screenshot of a camera roll. Real ones will know the phone world is the real world, too. Real ones will step out of Walters\' skin with a new-found appreciation for the poetry easily discovered on daily walks and in spam email folders. Needless to say: Ashley E. Walters is a Real One.\n\nSide note: I really want that hat. You’ll know which one I mean.\n\n-- Anna K. Crooks, author of girl poems\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s hour 5 of a 7 hour road trip. You look out the passenger side window. The land is flat and your eyes are starting to hurt. Ashley E Walters is driving. If you remember being 29, you’re starting to cry. Frenetic and unafraid, Saturn Returns is overwhelming in its ability to rescue the sublime from the mundane. Presented in two parts, two wholes, one hand steals images and the other holds open tabs. This work is not done lightly, but wryly, reveling in the absurdities that knock a body from (too much) despair. A masterful work.\n\n-- Devlin Grimm\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturn Returns presents the fluidity of mind-wandering and universality of strangeness one experiences when conducting deep introspection during a pivotal time period. Walters invites us into intimate scenes from her everyday life, experimentally layered, in image and text. We relish recent queries and glance through the rear window of her car. Walters gives space to the small moments that amount to monumental symbols of love, advice, longing, humility, recognition, and poignant absurdity. The presence of light gleams, is in transit, and is fleeting as Walters’ photographs and poems act as a mirror and at times a shadow of the real body.\n\n-- Ellen Phillips\n\n\n\n','https://bruiser.gumroad.com/l/saturnreturns?layout=discover&recommended_by=search',10,3),(409,'By the Horns','https://public-files.gumroad.com/s0g96tqs61ocrk6am23pa97cahti',220,'On vacation in Crete, a woman discovers unconventional ways to escape her dying marriage.\n\nElena Ferrante colliding with the fantastique.\n\n32 pages, PDF.','https://astridannerose.gumroad.com/l/by-the-horns?layout=discover&recommended_by=search',5,3),(410,'Cereus & Limnic: Definitive Collection','https://public-files.gumroad.com/sersamkpoyj72w4a7ca3pmnu9kcy',221,'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA military science fiction story with big ideas, Cereus & Limnic tells the story of two rival organizations locked in a bitter struggle for the future of humanity.\n\nOne conflict will decide the fate of millions in this spectacular work of fiction.\n\nThis book will guide you to greater insight about human society and how to change it for a brighter future.\n\nWhat You Get:\nCereus & Limnic (Novel Only)\n\n📖 An electronic copy of the Cereus & Limnic novel (495 pages) ($20 Value)\n\n\n\n\n\nCereus & Limnic: Definitive Collection\n\n📖 An electronic copy of the Cereus & Limnic novel (495 pages) ($20 Value)\n\n🎧 67 episodes of the Cereus & Limnic Audiodrama Podcast (AD-FREE, REMASTERED) in mp3 format (21 hrs 17 mins of audio) ($30 Value)\n\n📕 DLC STORY: “Operation Silent Thunder” The Legend of Cheeks (7500+ words) ($10 Value)\n\n🎵 28 Original songs (1 hr 40 mins of music) ($20 Value)\n\n🎞️ Mini- Documentary: One Man Show - “Making of Cereus & Limnic” ($30 Value)\n\n🎨 21 Pieces of original story artwork ($30 Value)\n\n🎧 20 Episodes of Cereus & Limnic: Behind-the-book Podcast (mp3 files) (6 hrs 11 mins of audio) ($30 Value)\n\n🎮 Instant access to Cereus & Limnic: Circular Dungeon Room (Game) ($10 Value)\n\n🎮 Instant access to Sci-fi Color Battle (Game) ($10 Value)\n\n🔊 Audio log - Plans for Cereus & Limnic 2 and 3 ($10 Value)\n\n\n\nCereus & Limnic: Definitive Collection + Video Novel\n\n📕 Everything in Cereus & Limnic: Definitive Collection\n\n🎞️ 21+ hrs of video\n\n🎨 60+ story images\n\n🎞️ 8 YouTube videos with the full story\n\n\n\nOperation Silent Thunder: The Legend of Cheeks (DLC ONLY)\n\n📕 DLC STORY: “Operation Silent Thunder” The Legend of Cheeks (7500+ words) ($10 Value)\n\n','https://khayden22.gumroad.com/l/cereus-limnic?layout=discover&recommended_by=search',9,3),(411,'Those Wyrd and Wonderful | Paperback','https://public-files.gumroad.com/2xwq7b0bojdegd6pafu39ggr1mr2',222,'The gods shake their snow globe and chuckle, for the world was not always silent and still.\n\nFor those interested in stories about a bunch of misfits who regularly confront the supernatural, fighting to become more than pawns between the games of cosmic horrors. Their company struggles against insurmountable odds, trauma and turmoil which cultivate in their own anxiety-riddled adventures. Magik often draws the ire of ruinous powers, and in a world where isolated frontier towns are crushed by relentless torrents of snowfall, vagabonds take all the help they can get, lest be wiped off the map. The events in my novel start similarly to the Klondike Gold Rush, as pioneers attempt to tame the unbound wilderness. Those at the mercy of the weather quickly discover fate pulling their strings, and beasts nipping at their heels, goading them further into the fray. In a world so untamed, everything may seem bleak and dismal, but there is still much joy in the world, hidden to all those too bitter or driven to drink. Whether we find love in our hobbies and craft, or each other, there is always balance, our light to guide way through the dark. Unofficially, my recipe is one part sour, one part sugar, stir, and lastly, top it all off with a pinch of existential dread.\n\nAfter the earth froze over in a great cataclysm, humanity took to the old city’s underground tunnels and survived the chill like vermin. Hundreds of years later, as the clans continue to clash over heat and scraps, people decide to test their mettle by reclaiming the world above only to discover that these lands rally against them by manner of tooth and claw.\n\nWilliam is one of those second-generation pioneer kids who’d rather forfeit his daily drudges than compete against those vagabonds racing to stake their claim. Alas, as the barrowtide season bears the brunt of bad weather, his frontier settlement is deemed just another lost cause. The young boy Jones is forced into a harsh reality, coming to terms on whether he’ll sink or swim, cast against an ever-rising white tide and the dark secrets harbored there.\n\nDealt a bad hand, William faces a hostile world where honest threats are always looming against him. “Those Wyrd and Wonderful” showcases the grim decisions of frontier life, because to thrive, one must first survive. An earnest lad learns to roll with these punches, neither losing his compassion, nor those morals while countless others around him have chosen to forget.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nA little bit about me, I’m a central Ohio native who has always been immersed in storytelling, studying art, design and all things creative. I earned my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Animation from the Columbus College of Art & Design. My professional background for awhile was in social media, where I managed accounts for a reality enterprise, art community, and several start-ups. Afterwards, I became an aquarium technician, visiting homes to take care of clients’ fishtanks and ponds. Then I decided to get out of the city, move to a small town, and kickstart my career as a writer.\n\nMy work details a world cast with rime, filled to the brim with unconventional creatures and drama, there’s a little something for everyone in his novels. I feature an eccentric slew of characters and down-to-earth grit, where those fictional few are spurred on a path of pure, unadulterated adventure, traversing untamed wilds, and confronting their harsh realities.\n\nI do have a separate book which I self-published but never really marketed, titled “A World of Honest Threats,” which introduces the icy narrative. It’s designed as a world-building book for D&D fans, detailing just what it takes to survive in my fictional winter wonderland. What sort of menagerie should navigators expect? Well, there’s the burly bison, timid troll-kin, those particular gremlins led by their pompous kit-king, and even that dreaded tundra terror who all have their parts to play. In a certain twist of events, I actually created my world first. Now I’m writing the tales of those who live it, and it all begins with this debut novel, “Those Wyrd and Wonderful,” the first of many more to come.\n____\n\nEmail me at marketing.trentlindsey@gmail.com with any questions.','https://honestthreats.gumroad.com/l/wyrd-and-wonderful?layout=discover&recommended_by=search',15,3),(412,'A Well Moderated Evening & Other Rambunctious Short Stories','https://public-files.gumroad.com/j9shle05dx1f7gmwyi7x2bj1wu2u',223,'Memorable, thought provoking, downright mad.\n\nThese are not bedtime stories.\n\nIn a time of blatantly recycled ideas, these new stories are a breath of fresh air.\n\nThey are safe to read, but it is the author\'s hope they are not.

Mike was starting to peak. I was dead sober and fucking miserable. Neither of my guitarists could figure out what to play. Jonathan would play a riff and Mike would just stand there with a slack-jawed expression. Jonathan would stop and mean-mug Mike. Mike would play his own riff and Jonathan would try to follow along, but with the peak of the trip coming on, Mike could hardly focus long enough to play in the same key, the same time signature, the same scale for more than a few seconds. Jim on drums was happy to be there, laughing at every false start. That was easy for him to do as he’d be going off to college at the end of the summer. Jamming with us was just his way of killing time until then. Dean on bass just sat there, smoking cigarettes and watching. He had almost no training whatsoever but was pretty good at following instructions and could play anything we tabbed out for him later.

Never looking beyond the next winter, his lot was unremarkable and one with little hope of improvement.

Their journey for answers — one Callum has little choice but to go on — leads him to learn of the terrible responsibilities that come with wielding the sword and of an enemy whose goals will change his world forever.\n\nPulling inspiration from the science fiction and fantasy media of his youth and the lessons learned throughout his life about overcoming adversity, Errant Hope is Damien Jennison\'s first novel and the first steps in an epic adventure that will sweep you away.\n\nYou can buy a copy of the eBook here on Gumroad.

They shared little in common, mostly their obsessions – with Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Mozart, Saul Bellow, Roberto Bolano, tennis and hockey.\n\nSomehow, summoning up a kind of courage or resolve he’d assumed was absent from his DNA, the first Brian Prousky left his day job, revealed his secret and dedicated himself full-time to writing. And the two Brian Prouskys became one. Now the author of four novels, Auden Triller (Is A Killer), God Might Forgive Gershwin Burr, The Anna Geller Invention and Healing Brian Esseintes, as well as a collection of short stories, Jupiter the Stupider, and two books of poetry, Body of Winter and Meeting Poems, he lives and works in Toronto, where most of his characters, who struggle with secret and often conflicted lives of their own, and who never quite fit in, do as well.','https://nextchapterbooks.gumroad.com/l/threads-of-life?layout=discover&recommended_by=search',8,3),(452,'We Said Goodbye To Gravity (32 pages)','https://public-files.gumroad.com/h4thpbhtceer62ju4i2jwfbhjjtn',252,'A collection of 6 short stories by yours truly.','https://chrisbaldie.gumroad.com/l/chKfW?layout=discover&recommended_by=search',4,3),(453,'Boulevard, Vol. 32, 1 (Fall 2016)','https://public-files.gumroad.com/h1eaexhqahu5h46zes4lideg0w4d',253,'Featuring new work by Zeina Hashem Beck, Diana M.

I can’t wait to buy it, and read it yay!\" - LR\n\nYou won\'t be able to put it down\n\n\"Well I stayed up nearly all night reading the second instalment! I couldn’t put it down. Very sad to get to the end!\" - LR\n\n\"Beautifully written\" - MF\n\nLearn a lot more about New Zealand society\n\n\"I was notably enthusiastic about S.G. Smith’s first novel, part one of what promises to be a long and fascinating journey. In Book 2, we follow Kate during her transition from girl to the edge of womanhood, learn a lot more about New Zealand society and Māori culture and life, and get deeply into the fascinating world that the author has created from the elements of the real New Zealand and her imagination\n\nThe world of Te Kererū is, as the author refers to it, “speculative fiction,” with the Māori group/clan and its village and the nearby city and lands specifically not closely based on any real life example. It seems to me to be a sort of idealized depiction, what could, and may, be in the future. I began to realize more as I read this second book that Kate is an archetype, a Stranger in a Strange Land who becomes embedded in a different culture and (perhaps?) brings new perspectives and a new integration of different worlds.\n\nBut this book is a sort of serial, bearing a resemblance to the great old movie houses where the audience come back every Saturday and watched another episode, with new revelations and resolution of some issues, followed by new complications.\n\nThe big complication is Kate’s budding womanhood\n\nIn this installment the big complication is Kate’s budding womanhood, but with surprising and important differences from the usual and well-worn tropes we’ve seen in a hundred Hollywood movies. Kate is exceptional, in some ways brilliant, wise beyond her years, but also very introverted and some might even say mildly “autistic.”\n\nIn fact, I’m as fascinated by Kate as by any character I’ve read in fiction for a long time. We learn a lot about her, but somehow most of it seems external, the keen observations of others. There is internal dialogue and descriptions of Kate’s thinking, and yet even after two books Kate is still something of a mystery to me, and I like that. She seems destined for something big–but what?\n\nThe author has skillfully built a a truly interesting world, and a woman, that I want to find out much more about. And that’s my definition of a good book.\n\nTe Kererū Book 2 – Shaking the Nest on GumRoad includes Book 1 as a package deal, so you don’t need to worry if you haven’t read the first volume. Highly recommended.\" - Neovictorian\n\nHere\'s what people are saying about Te Kererū - Part 1\nA gorgeous little story\n\n\"I sat in the sun yesterday and read your book. It is lovely and not something I usually read which is why it is nice to be given the opportunity.\n\nIt really is a gorgeous little story (and I know there is more to come). The descriptive details of the village and inhabitants is great and one can really imagine life there. I quite liked the gang related connections and wonder what is going on there. I expect there will be more to come\n\nAnyway it is a lovely story, well written and descriptive.\" - Adrienne N.\n\nA delightful little book\n\n\"The best thing about being on Twitter has been discovering new authors. I also love the humor, but good books > funny .gifs.\n\nI’ll do another post with the (long) list of fine writers and their books I’ve discovered there, but today we focus on one delightful little book (or Part I of a delightful long book) Te Kererū by Susan G. Smith.\"\n\nKate\'s something more than what she seems\n\n“Te Kererū” is the Māori name for the native New Zealand wood pigeon, a beautiful and tasty bird. When three-year-old Katherine Taylor, a “Pākehā” (white person) is orphaned by a massive landslide, she is adopted by the regional Māori chief–and by the village and its people. Given the nickname Te Kererū, little Kate is different, quiet, mysterious, apparently the proverbial “old soul.” But the book subtly hints she’s something more than this, something bigger…\n\nWithout trying hard in any way, we’re educated about the New Zealand Māori culture and society, something I had only a slight knowledge of before reading Te Kererū. The author obviously loves her country and its people and the book opened up a new piece of the world for me, as I believe it will for most readers.\n\nThe only thing I didn’t like about this book was that it ended\n\nHer style is clear, limpid is the old-fashioned word, mostly short declarative sentences, but skillfully layered one upon another, sips not gulps, and very satisfying, in the long run.\n\nThe story is developed through a series of scenes or vignettes, glimpses of events and pieces of conversations, a technique I also use and can appreciate. Each chapter is a facet of a gem, and gradually we begin to see something taking shape, a mission or a destiny, and…end of Book 1.\n\nLike the wonderful old movie serials, the present volume leaves the reader wanting more. This isn’t so common these days, but I’m all right with it. I understand the next book will be available soon, which I hope is true.\n\nBecause the only thing I didn’t like about this book was that it ended.\" - Neovictorian','https://sgsmith.gumroad.com/l/tekereru3?layout=discover&recommended_by=search',5,3),(456,'The Orphan and the King Series, Volume 2 : Love\'s Great Ransom','https://public-files.gumroad.com/e866mdnk2w7a7t5s87ao8qiaxm5f',254,'Written by Best-Selling Author Wendy Anne Hunt\n\nArt by Alphonso A.

Those tales were never written down. They were always whispered in the dark, and when Maryann started writing stories, they were different types entirely.\n\nAs a young child, she didn\'t consider that she would grow up to be a writer. She fancied herself quite the singer and thought she would someday sing in front of crowds of thousands. Alas, that proved to be more dream than reality.\n\nA diverse writer of columns, feature stores, short fiction, novels, screenplays and stage plays, Maryann has won numerous awards including being a semi-finalist at the Sundance Institute for her screenplay, A Question Of Honor. She has also received the Page Edwards Short Story Award and the 2015 Best Mystery award for Doubletake.\n\nMiller lives in a small town in NE Texas with one dog, and four cats. The cats rule!

Where exactly, I didn’t know. I had on my dungarees, work boots, red cotton t-shirt under my canvas jacket. Like I’d just been air-lifted from the pasture on my farm.\n\nFacing me was a woman with wings. A gorgeous woman with strong, beautiful wings.\n\nAnd her voice was like poured honey over buttered toast on a hot day. Smooth, lustrous, golden.\n\nI’d rather call her siren. Especially when I looked into her eyes. Vibrant green, like the glowing color of fireflies. But steady, piercing.\n\nHarpy stepped closer to me and I could see more detail in her thin, nearly sheer top. It seemed like a dancing leotard. Her long legs took her closer to me in graceful barefoot paces. A tail of cloth-like drape, like the sweep of tail feathers behind, barely grazed the floor and raised small puffs of dust as she strode toward me.\n\n“Why Harpy, why not Siren? With a face and eyes like that, you can have any lover you want.” I said.\n\n“Oh, and I have. They all loved me and went to their death for me. Too human. Short lifespans, inflated egos, puppy-dog eyes and utter devotion.” The Harpy sighed.\n\n“Why do you call yourself ‘Harpy’,” I asked. “The usual pictures are of an ugly monster with really only a woman’s face, the rest are parts of animals.”\n\nHarpy sighed. “Probably the same reason vampires and other creatures have such bad reputations. You can see my wings and yes I have claws.” She held up two fingers from one hand where long talons suddenly extended from her fingertips, then retracted as quickly. “But that is no different than cats, really. Practically, I can even hide my wings and walk among humans, the same as I’ve done for centuries. I’ve passed royalty and commoner alike and no one has known except when I wanted them to.” She sighed again and looked off into space.\n\n“May I ask why you brought me here and why I am tied up so tight?” I asked.\n\n“Because I want you to tell my side of the story....\"\n\nScroll Up and Get Your Copy Now.\n\nAlso available at most online ebook outlets: https://books2read.com/u/47zALL','https://livingsensical.gumroad.com/l/HarpyAntho?layout=discover&recommended_by=search',3,3),(481,'Lokis - Le manuscrit du professeur Wittemb - Prosper Merimee','https://public-files.gumroad.com/blh113l4nt70hj4g1927xqwrway5',257,'Le professeur Wittembach, philosophe allemand, se rend en Lituanie pour ses recherches.

As a public official, Mérimée travelled through France and Europe, from which he drew inspiration for his stories and novels. His first popular novella, \"Colomba\", was published in 1840. It is set in Corsica, and tells the story of the della Rebbia family, whose father has been murdered in an ambush, believed by his daughter to have been perpetrated by the town\'s mayor, Lawyer Barricini. She implores her brother, Lieutenant Orso della Rebbia, to avenge their father\'s death, but Orso does not share her passionate ancestral pride.

Il monta sur le trône à un âge encore plus précoce : dix ans. Sa mère qui continua l\'exercice du pouvoir. Charles IX était tout aussi fragile physiquement et psychologiquement que ses frères. Il était inconstant, tantôt sous l\'influence de sa mère, tantôt sous celle de Coligny.\nEn 1570, sa mère mit fin à la troisième guerre de religion en lui faisant signer la paix de Saint-Germain qui accordait la liberté de culte aux protestants, ainsi que plusieurs places fortes, dont La Rochelle. Il se lia peu à peu d\'amitié avec Coligny qui en profita pour le convaincre de relancer la guerre des Flandres, dans laquelle la France devait porter secours aux protestants contre l\'intolérance du pouvoir espagnol. Sa mère qu\'une guerre ouverte avec l\'Espagne inquiétait, décida avec l\'aide des Guise l\'élimination de Coligny. Mais l\'attentat rata. Affolée par les conséquences de ce ratage, alors que Paris hébergeait un grand nombre de protestants venus assister au mariage d\'Henri de Navarre, Catherine, avec l\'aide de son autre fils Henri, convainquit Charles IX de l\'élimination de tous les chefs protestants. Ce massacre qui eut lieu lors de la Saint-Barthélemy 1572 s\'emballa avec la participation de tout le peuple et s\'étandit à toute la France.\nTout au long de son règne, il souffrit de la préférence de sa mère pour son frère Henri. Il se réjouit lorsque celui-ci dut partir après son élection au trône de Pologne (1573). Mais malade, il mourut à la veille de ses 24 ans. Il fut remplacé par son frère Henri, le duc d\'Anjou et bref roi de Pologne.','https://bookcollections.gumroad.com/l/bbxrn?layout=discover&recommended_by=search',6,3),(486,'Rocambole - La corde du pendu - Tome I - Pierre Ponson du Terrail','https://public-files.gumroad.com/bvcun8zs9akoeu2rprxc35mtgqhm',257,'Pierre Alexis Ponson du Terrail (1829-1871)\n\n\n\n\n\"L’écroulement du souterrain durait toujours.\n\nLa voûte de la galerie se détachait par fragments de blocs énormes.\n\nLe sol continuait à mugir et à trembler.\n\nOn eût dit un de ces tremblements de terre qui ébranlent les cités du nouveau monde.\n\nVanda était tombée à genoux et priait.\n\nPauline, suspendue au cou de Polyte, lui disait :\n\n– Au moins, nous mourrons ensemble !\n\nMilon hurlait de fureur et brandissait ses poings énormes en répétant :\n\n– Ah ! les gredins de fenians ! les propres à rien ! les canailles !\n\nMarmouset, lui, regardait le maître.\n\nLe maître était calme, debout, le front haut.\n\nIl semblait attendre la fin de ce cataclysme avec la tranquillité d’un homme qui se sait au-dessus de la mort.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSuite de \"Les démolitions de Paris\"\n\nDernière aventure de Rocambole écrite par Pierre Alexis Ponson du Terrail.','https://bookcollections.gumroad.com/l/rmwxt?layout=discover&recommended_by=search',6,3),(487,'Rocambole - En prison - Pierre Ponson du Terrail','https://public-files.gumroad.com/fpwk0862bm1jrskrpzm8plq8upgr',257,'Enfin un héros détestable.
